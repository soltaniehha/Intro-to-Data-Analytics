The company has experienced steady growth in recent years, but as a tech firm, it also faces significant market volatility. Your goal is to calculate the 9-year projected growth, adjust it based on market volatility, and assess the growth potential.\n","\n","Calculate the 9-Year Projected Growth: The company's annual growth rate is 12%.

To adjust for this, multiply the projected growth by a volatility index factor. Assume a Volatility Index (VIX) factor of 1.25, meaning the projection could be increased by 25% due to market optimism or risk. Multiply the projected growth by 1.25 and round the result to two decimal places.\n","\n","Classify the Growth Potential based on the adjusted result:\n","\n","If the adjusted projected growth is greater than 3, categorize it as **'High Growth Potential'**.\n","If the adjusted projected growth is between 1.5 and 3, categorize it as **'Moderate Growth Potential'**.\n","If the adjusted projected growth is less than 1.5, categorize it as **'Low Growth Potential'**.\n","\n","Provide the final adjusted growth figure and the categorized growth potential.
