    "Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it.\n",
    "For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tap into the power of this data science ecosystem, however, first requires familiarity with the Python language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, this report in no way aims to be a comprehensive introduction to programming, or a full introduction to the Python language itself; if that is what you are looking for, you might check out one of the recommended references listed in Resources for Learning notebook.\n",
    "Instead, this will provide a whirlwind tour of some of Python's essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language.\n",
    "Once we have the basics under our belt we will move forward to the more advanced packages mentioned above."

    "\n",
    "- [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) gives you Python interpreter itself, along with a command-line tool called ``conda`` which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared toward Python packages, similar in spirit to the ``apt`` or ``yum`` tools that Linux users might be familiar with.\n",
    "- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) includes both Python and ``conda``, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any of the packages included with Anaconda can also be installed manually on top of Miniconda; for this reason I suggest starting with Miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, download and install the Miniconda package – make sure to choose a version with Python 3 – and then install the IPython notebook package:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[~]$ conda install jupyter\n",
